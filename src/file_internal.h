/**
 * Turn the platform's own complaint into this library's vocabulary.
 *
 * The distinctions drawn are the ones a caller can act on.  The dividing line
 * is not severity but **determinism**:  `GCU_FILE_ERR_IO` means the filesystem
 * tried and something went wrong, which a caller may reasonably retry or
 * report as a device problem.  A failure to resolve the path is not that - it
 * will never succeed on a retry, and it is a statement about the path rather
 * than about the device - so those become `GCU_FILE_ERR_NOT_FOUND` however
 * they are spelled:  the path is absent, a component of it is not a directory,
 * or it goes round a loop of symbolic links.
 *
 * `ENAMETOOLONG` is the one that looks like it belongs with those and does
 * not.  The three above are statements about the filesystem's current *state*:
 * nothing the caller does to its argument changes them, and they can stop being
 * true while the caller sits still, because somebody else created a file or
 * replaced a link.  `ENAMETOOLONG` is a statement about the *argument*, and
 * only the caller can change it - so "try the same call again later" is
 * coherent for the first three and incoherent for this one.  That is
 * `GCU_FILE_ERR_INVALID`.
 *
 * With one caveat, since somebody will eventually read that code as the wider
 * claim:  `NAME_MAX` and `PATH_MAX` are per-filesystem, so `ENAMETOOLONG` is a
 * property of the argument *and* the filesystem rather than of the argument
 * alone.  The same path can be too long on one mount and fine on another.  It
 * does not change the mapping - the caller still has to change its input - but
 * `ERR_INVALID` here means "not usable against this filesystem", not "malformed
 * string".
 *
 * Everything else stays `GCU_FILE_ERR_IO`.  Nobody can usefully branch on the
 * difference between `EIO` and `ENXIO`.
