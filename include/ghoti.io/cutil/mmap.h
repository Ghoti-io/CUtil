/**
 * @file
 * Reading a file as memory instead of copying it into a buffer.
 *
 * `gcu_file_read()` reads a whole file into an allocation; this maps it
 * instead, so a large file costs address space rather than resident memory
 * and the kernel pages in what is actually touched. Worth it for files large
 * relative to memory, for random access into a large file, and for sharing
 * one copy between processes. Not worth it for small files, where the mapping
 * setup costs more than the read.
 *
 * ## Touching the mapping can raise a signal, not return an error
 *
 * This is the property that makes a mapping different from a buffer, and it
 * is not optional or avoidable.
 *
 * A read from a buffer cannot fail. A read from a mapping is a page fault
 * that the kernel services by reading the file, and if that read fails -- an
 * I/O error, a network filesystem going away, or **the file being truncated
 * under you** -- the process gets `SIGBUS`. There is no return value to
 * check, because the failure happens at a memory access.
 *
 * So: map files you control, and do not map a file another process is
 * shortening. If that is not something you can promise, read the file
 * normally. A truncation racing a read through `gcu_file_read()` gives you a
 * short buffer; the same race here kills the process.
 *
 * ## An empty file maps to nothing, successfully
 *
 * `mmap` cannot map zero bytes and `CreateFileMapping` refuses a zero-length
 * file, so an empty file would naturally be an error. It is not one here: the
 * call succeeds with `data` NULL and `size` 0, because "the file is empty" is
 * an ordinary answer and making every caller special-case it would mean every
 * caller getting it wrong once. Do not dereference `data` without checking
 * `size`, which is true of any buffer.
 *
 * ## Writes
 *
 * A writable mapping is written by storing into `data`. There is no write
 * call. Stores may reach the file at any time or not until unmap, so
 * gcu_mmap_sync() exists for the case where the order matters -- a crash
 * between two stores can leave the file with either, neither, or only the
 * second. A writable mapping cannot change the file's length: to grow a file,
 * write it normally, or unmap, extend, and map again.
